        <div>
            <h2 id="fancy">Our Story</h2>
            <p id="normal">Developed by the finest developers, Extra-Terrestrial Encroachers is a hit game made by three
                Junior Cert students using MakeCode Arcade, Microsofts free block coding software. <br>
                With a six week limit, these three students were able to make a game that incorporates groundbreaking
                movement, tremendous graphics, and a truly inspiring story.

                The development began how every triple A game developer thinks of a new and creative way to manufacture
                something new, unique and never-seen before. With a brainstorm.
                <strong>John Bernard Basanes, Maksymilian Surowiec and Hubert Kozłowski</strong> gathered together to
                think of a few quick ideas for their coding CBA.
                While everyone else was thinking of platformer games, and maze games, this legendary trio had a
                completely different idea.
                They were going to make a Space Shooter game, and nothing was going to stop them.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 id="fancy">Development</h2>
            <p id="normal">They quickly began to scribble down their ideas on scrunched up scraps of paper.
                They knew that this was going to be a success, and nothing was going to stop them from achieving it.
                However, they soon began to realise that there was a massive flaw in their plan.
                Not everything would be able to be implemented into their game, as not everything would work well
                together. </p>

            <p id="normal">The trio compromised, and each member of the development team chose three of their best ideas
                to be put into the game.
                They believed that this would be the best way to go.</p>

            <p id="normal"><strong>John Bernard</strong> chose to add an interesting story to the game, chose the game
                to be in space, and for there to be a final boss in the game.</p>
            <p id="normal"><strong>Maksymilian</strong> decided to add different types of enemies, such as asteroids,
                and varying types of aliens that would have to be fought. He also thought of implementing lives, and a
                score system to the game.</p>
            <p id="normal">And finally, <strong>Hubert</strong> decided to go above and beyond, and make a custom,
                multipage website for the project. He thought of the menu screen, the artstyle for the game, and many
                other crucial elements of the game. </p>
            <p id="normal">And so, the development began. John Bernard created a Google Docs document for the team to be
                able to track their progress.
                <strong>John Bernard</strong> and <strong>Maksymilian</strong> worked hand-in-hand to work at maximum
                efficiency, as Hubert managed to finish the website in record-breaking time.
                Everything was going to plan. As one student was busy, the other was bug testing and problem solving.
                It was as if they were performing a perfect symphony, working in harmony.
                It was a <i>heavenly sight</i>, some might say. </p>

            <p id="normal"><strong>Below are some images of the code created by John Bernard Basanes and Maksymilian

                <p id="normal">What we each thought of the game we managed to produce.<br></p>
                <ul>
                    <li id="item1"><strong>Maksymilian Surowiec:</strong></li>
                    <p id="normal">Overall, I think that this project was a huge success. Not only did we create a fully functioning game, we also created a game that each of us had an influence over the development, and manufacturing of the game. I can't think of how I would be able to do this project by myself. Looking back, I wish we had a little teeny tiny bit more time, just to polish a few bits and pieces, but other than that, the game came out better than I ever would have imagined. If I were to do anything differently, I would try to code faster, and try to not make the same mistakes over and over again, which would save us a lot of time.</p>

                    <li id="item2"><strong>John Bernard Basanes:</strong></li>
                    <p id="normal">It found it really exciting to make this game. I thought the fact that MakeCode Arcade did not allow multiple people to work on a project at once would become a barrier for us but we easily overcame it. I honestly didn't think the game would turn out this good but we made it happen. I really enjoyed creating the sheet music for the game.</p>

                    <li id="item3"><strong>Hubert Kozlowski:</strong></li>
                    <p id="normal">Looking back, I recognize that there were areas where I could have improved. For instance, I could have delegated tasks more effectively and streamlined communication channels to foster greater efficiency within the team. Nonetheless, I am proud of the unique perspective I brought to the project and the positive impact it had on the game's overall quality.</p>
